### Testing Best Practices  
- Don't test CSS classes, DOM structure, or styling details in unit tests.
- Test user-visible behavior and content, not implementation details.
- Write tests that survive refactoring without breaking functionality.

## Logger Examples
`logger.fmt` is a template literal function that should be used to bring variables into the structured logs.
```javascript
import logger from '@/logger';


logger.debug(logger.fmt`Cache miss for user: ${userId}`);
logger.info("Updated profile", { profileId: 345 });
logger.warn("Rate limit reached for endpoint", {
  endpoint: "/api/results/",
  isEnterprise: false,
});
logger.error("Failed to process payment", {
  orderId: "order_123",
  amount: 99.99,
});

```
